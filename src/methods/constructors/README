Task 1:
The Computer class should have the following constructors:

- default constructor Computer() which initializes the field

isNotebook with a value of false, and the operationSystem field with "Win XP".

- constructor with parameters Computer(int year, double price, double
hardDiskMemory, double freeMemory) which first calls the constructor by
default and then initialize the rest of the fields with the values
submitted as arguments.

- constructor with parameters Computer(int year, double price, boolean
isNotebook, double hardDiskMemory, double freeMemory, String operationSystem) which
initializes all fields with the values passed as arguments to
the constructor.

- int comparePrice(Computer otherComp) method that compares the prices of 2
the computer.

If the price of the first computer (the one for which the method is called) is more
higher than that of the computer passed as an argument, the method returns -1. If
the price of the computer passed as an argument is higher, 1 is returned, and if
are equal, the method returns a value of 0.

Within the main method, create several objects of type Computer
(via one of the available constructors).
To compare the prices of some of the computers (using the method
comparePrice) and display an appropriate message.

Task 2: Create a Student class describing a student
The class should have the following fields:

name – name of the student
subject - specialty
grade - success
yearInCollege - course
age – years of the student
isDegree - whether graduated or not
money - money from scholarships

The class should define the following constructors:
-default constructor that sets the following values to
fields: grade = 4.0, yearInCollege = 1, isDegree = false, money = 0

-constructor with parameters that calls the default constructor and
initializes (sets initial values) the remaining fields of
the class

The class should define the following methods:

- void upYear() method that increments the college year by one if
the student has not graduated, otherwise it brings out the appropriate
message. If after incrementing the year becomes 4, sets true to
the isDegree field

-method double receiveScholarship(double min, double amount) – adds the amount
amount the money of the student only if his success rate is higher or equal
of the minimum success passed as a parameter (min) and if its age is
under 30 years old.

The method returns the current money to the student (after their eventual
raise)
To write a Demo class (with main method) that demonstrates the use of
the Student class.
