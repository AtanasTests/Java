Create a Computer class that represents a computer.
The class should have the following fields:

year – a numerical value indicating the year of manufacture of the

price – numeric value (does not have to be an integer) showing
the price of the computer

isNotebook - boolean value - whether the computer is a notebook or not

hardDiskMemory – numeric value for the size of the hard disk

freeMemory – numerical value indicating the amount of free

operationSystem – a text field for the computer's operating

The class should define the following methods:

-method void changeOperationSystem(String newOperationSystem) that changes
the value of the operationSystem field with the value passed as
parameter.

-method void useMemory(double memory) which decrements free memory


If the value of the argument is greater than the free memory, print
message "Not enough free memory!

Create a ComputerDemo class, with a main method.
Within the main method, create 2 objects of type Computer.
To assign values to each of the computers for
year, price,hardDiskMemory, freeMemory, operationSystem.
Let one computer to is laptop.
 One of the two computers should be allocated memory 100 (via
useMemory method), and on the other, to change the operating system (via
changeOperationSystem method), then display them all
fields on both computers.
