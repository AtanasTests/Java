Create a class StudentGroup representing
a group of students from same major.

Class Fields:
groupSubject – major of the students in the group
Student[] students – Students in the group (array of objects of class Student)
freePlaces – free places in the group

The class should define the following constructors:

- a default constructor that creates places for 5 students in the group
(initializes the students field with a new array of 5 elements)
 and sets a value 5 on the freePlaces field

- constructor StudentGroup(String subject) which first calls the constructor
default and sets a value to the groupSubject field

The class should define the following methods:

- method void addStudent(Student s) which adds a student to the group(add
it to the array at the next empty position) if the specialty of
of the student matches that of the group,
 and of course if there are free places.

After adding a student to the group, reduce the available seats in
the group.
- method void emptyGroup() which frees all places in the group (set
a new empty array for the students field)
and assigns a value of 5 to the field freePlaces.

- theBestStudent() method - Returns the name of the student with the highest GPA in
the group.

- printStudentsInGroup() method - Outputs information (Name, GPA, ...)for


To write a College class (with a main method) that demonstrates the usage
of the Student and StudentGroup classes
(Creates several students, adds scholarship to some of them, transfers
some of them in a higher year. It creates several groups of students, he adds
students in them, gets the name of the best student from one of the groups....)
